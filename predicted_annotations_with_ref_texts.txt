The inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) was initially isolated from rat brain as an enzyme that hydrolyzes the 4-position phosphate of PI(3,4)P2, and to a lesser degree inositol(3,4)bisphosphate (Ins((3,4)P2) and Ins(3,4,5)P3, in vitro (Norris et al., 1997; Norris et al., 1995). The ability of INPP4B to hydrolyze PI(3,4,5)P3 and its effects on phosphoinositides in intact cells was not investigated, thus, the in vivo function of INPP4B remains elusive. However, INPP4B expression was recently shown to be silenced in malignant proerythroblasts. These cells displayed increased phospho-Akt levels, which could be reduced by re-expression of INPP4B (Barnache et al., 2005). In addition, recent studies described a frequently deleted region in breast cancer cell lines and basal-like, high grade breast tumors using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization analysis (chromosome location 4q31.1-31.21 and chromosome location 4q31.3-q32.1, respectively) comprising 6 genes, including INPP4B (Naylor et al., 2005; Bergamaschi et al., 2006; Chin et al., 2007). Johannsdottir et al. also found LOH in this region in breast cancers (Johannsdottir et al., 2004). Further, INPP4B was identified out of a collection of RNAis to give rise to anchorage-independent growth in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) (Westbrook et al., 2005). ... Since we found high cellular senescence upon loss of both, INPP4B and PTEN, unless Trp53 was also knocked down, we further investigated whether tumors with deletion of either lipid phosphatase (INPP4B or PTEN) or both showed Trp53 mutations | Discourse facet: Results_Citation| Run ID: BLLIP 1

Topic ID: D1413_EVAL | Citance Number: 9 | Citation Text: Kolfschoten et al.  identified a number of genes in their screen, a couple of which had previously been implicated as possible tumor suppressors. They concentrated, however, on the homeodomain transcription factor PITX1. Knockdown of this gene allows fibroblasts to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. The mechanism appears to involve constitutive activation of the Ras signaling pathways at the level of GTP loading onto Ras itself, suggesting that PITX1 might control the expression of one of the negative regulators of Ras of the GTPase-activating protein  family. An analysis of the sequences of the promoters of the eight human genes encoding Ras GAPs led them to concentrate on RASAL1, a calcium-sensitive member of the family . PITX1 directly controls the expression of RASAL1, with the reduction in GAP activity when PITX1 and consequently RASAL1 expression is lost being sufficient to induce the activation of endogenous wild-type Ras proteins within the cell . Loss of PITX1 thus has the potential to have a similar effect to mutation of RAS genes in terms of activation of downstream Ras effector pathways | Reference Offset: [537-724', 6074-6389', 7630-7936'] | Reference Text: However, a large proportion of these cancers still retain wild-type RAS alleles, suggesting that either the RAS pathway is activated in a distinct manner or another pathway is deregulated ... The activity of RAS is tightly regulated by two opposing components: GTP-exchange factors (GEFs) that induce dissociation of GDP, which allows binding of GTP, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that trigger the hydrolysis of bound GTP and attenuate RAS activity ( Repasky et al., 2004 and Wolthuis and Bos, 1999) ... Using this approach, we identified knockdown (kd) constructs targeting the Kru¨ppel-like transcription factor KLF4, the proapoptotic calcium binding protein PDCD6 (ALG-2), and the homeodomain pituitary transcription factor PITX1, with a transforming activity comparable to RASV12 overexpression (Figure 1D) | Discourse facet: Discussion_Citation| Run ID: BLLIP 1

Topic ID: D1413_EVAL | Citance Number: 9 | Citation Text: Kolfschoten et al.  identified a number of genes in their screen, a couple of which had previously been implicated as possible tumor suppressors. They concentrated, however, on the homeodomain transcription factor PITX1. Knockdown of this gene allows fibroblasts to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. The mechanism appears to involve constitutive activation of the Ras signaling pathways at the level of GTP loading onto Ras itself, suggesting that PITX1 might control the expression of one of the negative regulators of Ras of the GTPase-activating protein  family. An analysis of the sequences of the promoters of the eight human genes encoding Ras GAPs led them to concentrate on RASAL1, a calcium-sensitive member of the family . PITX1 directly controls the expression of RASAL1, with the reduction in GAP activity when PITX1 and consequently RASAL1 expression is lost being sufficient to induce the activation of endogenous wild-type Ras proteins within the cell . Loss of PITX1 thus has the potential to have a similar effect to mutation of RAS genes in terms of activation of downstream Ras effector pathways | Reference Offset: [537-724', 6074-6389', 7630-7936'] | Reference Text: However, a large proportion of these cancers still retain wild-type RAS alleles, suggesting that either the RAS pathway is activated in a distinct manner or another pathway is deregulated ...

Topic ID: D1415_EVAL | Citance Number: 4 | Citation Text: Marson and colleagues  recently performed ChIP-seq experiments with four general transcription factors in human and mouse cells. They then combined their data with those from previous studies on epigenetic markers. Using a variety of features such as evolutionary conservation and distance of the peak from the known miRNA genes, they assigned an ad hoc score to each putative TSS. A positive score indicated that the TSS is likely to belong to the miRNA and a negative score indicated that the TSS likely belonged to another gene. Although their study is very different than ours in the methodology followed  and the proteins targeted by the ChIP, comparing the two can be useful. Overall, we found the two datasets are comparable with respect to miRNA promoter characteristics. Furthermore, we ran the CPPP algorithm on their data and verified most of their predicted promoters. In particular, there are 44 TSSs associated with intergenic miRNAs with positive Marson score ; and CPPP scored all but three of them as likely to contain a core promoter . The two datasets  include one miRNA gene and one miRNA cluster with well studied TSSs: cluster miR-23a~miR-27a~miR-24-2 , and gene miR-21 .

Topic ID: D1415_EVAL | Citance Number: 4 | Citation Text: Marson and colleagues  recently performed ChIP-seq experiments with four general transcription factors in human and mouse cells. They then combined their data with those from previous studies on epigenetic markers. Using a variety of features such as evolutionary conservation and distance of the peak from the known miRNA genes, they assigned an ad hoc score to each putative TSS. A positive score indicated that the TSS is likely to belong to the miRNA and a negative score indicated that the TSS likely belonged to another gene. Although their study is very different than ours in the methodology followed  and the proteins targeted by the ChIP, comparing the two can be useful. Overall, we found the two datasets are comparable with respect to miRNA promoter characteristics. Furthermore, we ran the CPPP algorithm on their data and verified most of their predicted promoters. In particular, there are 44 TSSs associated with intergenic miRNAs with positive Marson score ; and CPPP scored all but three of them as likely to contain a core promoter . The two datasets  include one miRNA gene and one miRNA cluster with well studied TSSs: cluster miR-23a~miR-27a~miR-24-2 , and gene miR-21 .
